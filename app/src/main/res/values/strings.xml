    <string name="title">Welcome to the Enigma in Android.\nHere are some useful tips for you:
            You can choose a specific rotor from the given rotors for each of the five slots.
        (i.e., choose an item from each drop-down box below `Setting`)
        Then you can choose to give a more detailed setting by typing in the line of `IPs, ARs and
        plugboard.` Note that IPs stands for initial positions while ARs stands for alphabet rings.
        If you do not want to make the settings more complex, just
        ignore that line.\n\nAfter you finish the settings, you can type your messages (any
        characters from the 26 English letters in either upper case or lower case) in the first
        frame with green border. Then, simply press `ENCODE`, and the encoded message will be
        shown in the second green-border frame.\nThe last tip, you can press the encoded messages
        to copy them into your clipboard.
